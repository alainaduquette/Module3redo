Hi! So far I was able to get through each code and managed to have it print which is great. I have not yet figgured out how to write the code to another text file and am working on completing that. If you happen to have any pointers to share that would be great! I did recieve some help from my tutoring session on the elction pypoll.

Please see below the links I stumbled opon on google to help with the creation.
